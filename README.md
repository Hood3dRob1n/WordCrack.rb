WordCrack.rb
============

This is just a simple Hasher/Cracker script I wrote for fun and cause I am having some issues with latest Nvidia drivers and hashcat :p

Capable of cracking MD5, SHA1, Joomla, VB, SMF, & IPB Hash Formats given a wordlist or directory of wordlists.

Nothing fancy, but not a system hog either so can run in background without any pains and its easy to use.

Enjoy!
